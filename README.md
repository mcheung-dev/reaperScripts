# Reaper Scripts for Game Audio and Sound Design
This is a database of scripts that I wrote for Reaper DAW. Sharing them here for the game audio community as well. Enjoy!

SWS and the js_ReaScriptAPI extensions are both required to be installed for select scripts to work correctly.
# Installation 
You can install these scripts by using ReaPack. In Reaper, go to the menu bar: Extension > ReaPack > Import Repositories... and copy and past the link below into the dialogue box.

# Tools 
## mc_FastFileRenamer - Batch File Renamer Tool
This tool is designed to assist with renaming media items within Reaper. It replicates the functionality of the FastFileRenamer windows app, enabling you to replace, remove, and insert naming patterns effortlesslyâ€”all with a single click.
