# Reaper Scripts for Game Audio and Sound Design
This is a database of scripts that I wrote for Reaper DAW. Thought I'd share them as they are useful for my workflow and could be useful for the community as well. Enjoy!

# Installation 
You can install these scripts by using ReaPack. In Reaper, go to the menu bar: Extension > ReaPack > Import Repositories... and copy and past the link below into the dialogue box.
