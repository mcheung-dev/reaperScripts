# Reaper Scripts for Game Audio and Sound Design
This is a database of scripts that I wrote for Reaper DAW. Sharing them here for the game audio community as well. Enjoy!

SWS, js_ReaScriptAPI and ReaImGui extensions are required to be installed for scripts to work correctly.
# Installation 
You can install these scripts by using ReaPack. In Reaper, go to the menu bar: Extension > ReaPack > Import Repositories... and copy and past the link below into the dialogue box.
